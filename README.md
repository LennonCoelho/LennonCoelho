### Hey there! I am using GitHub 😁

Hi, my name is Lennon Coelho from Brazil (🇧🇷). I am a Front-End engineer who likes to build applications with clean code maintaining high performance and usability. I've been interested in Front-End since I was 15 years old and I am continually improving my knowledge along with the needs of the market. Clean code with best programming practices.

I am a bicycle enthusiast, in my spare time I like to practice BMX (🚲), to watch series (📺), to listen to music (🎵) and like to enjoy the beautiful life things.

Would you like to find me?
