### Hey there! I am using GitHub ðŸ˜Ž

Hi, my name is Lennon Coelho, from Minas Gerais in Brazil and I have been working with Frontend since I was 15 years old, continually improving my knowledge.

I like to build applications with clean code maintaining high performance and usability, always with best programming practices.

- Expertise in analysis and development of web and mobile applications using modern technologies and compatibility with older browsers;
- Performance analysis and optimization in the final build file.
- Experience in component library development aimed at code reuse;
- Building applications with test coverage;

Would you like to find me?
