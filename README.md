### Hey there! I am using GitHub 😁

Hi, my name is Lennon Coelho, from Minas Gerais in Brazil and I've been working with Front-End since I was 15 years old, continually improving my knowledge. I like to build applications with clean code maintaining high performance and usability, always with best programming practices.

I am a bicycle enthusiast, in my spare time I like to practice BMX (🚲), to watch series (📺), to listen to music (🎵) and like to enjoy the beautiful life things.

Would you like to find me?
